<P>I am a PhD candidate in the Department of Statistics and Data Science at SUSTech, 
  privileged to be under the guidance of <a href="https://faculty.sustech.edu.cn/">Prof. Jian Qing Shi</a>.
  Beginning Aug. 2025, I will join the Department of Statistics at the University of Michigan as a 
  postdoctoral researcher under the mentorship of 
  <a href="https://yangchenfunstatistics.github.io/yangchen.github.io/">Prof. Yang Chen</a>.</P>

  
<h2>Education</h2> 
<ul>
 <li>Ph.D. in Mathematics, SUSTech, (Sept. 2020 – Present) <em>Expected completion: June 2025</em></li>
 <li>B.S. in Statistics, SUSTech (Sept. 2016 – June 2020)</li>
</ul>  
  
<h2>Research Interests</h2>
  My research interests integrates statistical modeling with theoretical foundations, machine learning, 
  and data-driven insights to transform complex data into actionable solutions for real-world challenges. 
  My past and ongoning projects encompasses the following domains:
<ul>
 <li>Multimodal large-scale spatio-temporal data modeling with efficient Bayesian computational algorithms.</li>
 <li>Irregular functional data analysis with applications in free-lving acceleration data.</li>
  <li>Clinical trial design for ordinal responses data.</li>
 <li>Psychometric scale development and validation.</li>
</ul>
<b>Research Overview:</b> My Ph.D. focus on advancing functional data analysis for irregular (data with shape constraints, or varying
  covariance structures), high-dimensional datasets, emphasizing applications in gait data acquired from individuals 
  with neurodegenerative diseases via wearable devices. During this period, I conducted an efficient clinical trail 
  design for comparisions of treatments with ordinal responses with sequential monitoring and response-adaptive 
  randomization under the supervisor <a href="https://www.sta.cuhk.edu.hk/shcheung/">Prof. Siu Hung Cheung</a>.
  I co-developed a novel scale Neuo-11 with the Department of Neurology, Shenzhen People's Hospital and conducted the
  structural data analysis and statistically validated the scale for somatic symptom disorder screening.
