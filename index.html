I am an incoming postdoctoral researcher in the Department of Statistics 
  at the University of Michigan (Aug. 2025-July 2028), under the mentor of 
  <a href="https://yangchenfunstatistics.github.io/yangchen.github.io/"> Prof. Yang Chen </a>. 
  Currently, I am a PhD candidate in the Department of Statistics and Data Science at 
SUSTech. I am privileged to be under the guidance of 
  <a href="https://faculty.sustech.edu.cn/"> Prof. Jian Qing Shi</a>. <br />
  
<h2> Education </h2> 
<ul>
 <li><p> Ph.D. in Mathematics, SUSTech, Sept.2020-Present (Expected June 2025)
 </p> </li>
 <li><p> B.S. in Statistics, SUSTech, Sept. 2016-June 2020
 </p> </li>
</ul>  
  
<h2> Research Interests </h2>
  My research interests integrates statistical modeling with theoretical foundations, machine learning, 
  and data-driven insights to transform complex data into actionable solutions for real-world challenges. 
  My past and ongoning projects encompasses the following domains:
<ul>
 <li><p> Multimodal large-scale spatio-temporal data modeling with efficient Bayesian computational algorithms (Begin in Aug. 2025).
 </p> </li>
 <li><p> Irregular functional data analysis with applications (Sept. 2020-Present).
 </p> </li>
  <li><p> Comparison of treatments with ordinal response in clinical trials (Jan. 2020-July 2022).
 </p> </li>
 <li><p> Questionarie verification (Mar. 2020-Aug. 2023).
 </p> </li>
</ul>
<b>Research Overview:</b> My Ph.D. focus on advancing FDA for irregular (data with shape constraints, or varying
  covariance structures), high-dimensional datasets, emphasizing applications in gait data acquired from individ
  uals with neurodegenerative diseases via wearable devices. During this period, I conducted an efficient clinical trail 
  design for compariosons of treatments with ordinal response with sequential monitoring and response-adaptive 
  randomization under the supervisor <a href="https://www.sta.cuhk.edu.hk/shcheung/"> Prof. Siu Hung Cheung </a>.
  I Co-developed a novel scale Neuo-11 with the Department of Neurology, Shenzhen People's Hospital and conducted the
  structual data analysis and statistically validated the scale for somatic symptom disorder screening.
